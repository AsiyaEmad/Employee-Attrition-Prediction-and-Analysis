# Employee Attrition Prediction and Analysis
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict employee turnover (attrition) within an organization. By analyzing key factors such as demographics, job roles, performance, and tenure, the project aims to identify employees at risk of leaving. The ultimate goal is to enable organizations to implement proactive retention strategies, reducing turnover costs and improving employee satisfaction.

## Datasets
We are using the following datasets for this project:
1. [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
2. [Employee Attrition and Factors](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/employee-attrition-and-factors)
3. [Employee Attrition Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/employee-attrition-dataset)
