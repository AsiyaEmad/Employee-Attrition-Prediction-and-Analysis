# Employee-Attrition-Prediction-and-Analysis
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict employee turnover (attrition) within an organization. By analyzing key factors such as demographics, job roles, performance, and tenure, the project aims to identify employees at risk of leaving. The ultimate goal is to enable organizations to implement proactive retention strategies, reducing turnover costs and improving employee satisfaction.

# Features
-Comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-Advanced feature engineering to enhance predictive power.
-Development and optimization of machine learning models for attrition prediction.
-Deployment of the best-performing model as a web service or API.
-MLOps integration for monitoring, scalability, and retraining.

# Project Highlights
-Interactive Visualizations: Gain insights into factors influencing attrition.
-Predictive Analytics: Use state-of-the-art algorithms to identify at-risk employees.
-Deployment-Ready: Real-time predictions with an easy-to-use interface for HR teams.
